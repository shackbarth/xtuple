### What we're about

xTuple is open-source business management software. The code is managed by an eponymous
company in Norfolk, VA, and our community stretches around the world. Our web application
is implemented as an [HTML5 node.js app](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple/wiki/Overview).

Most of our commercial customers are inventory-based manufacturers or distributors, and we have a 
fair amount of commercially-licensed code to specifically support these use-cases. That said,
businesses of all sorts, even services-based companies, run their operations on our open-source 
core.

We're always happy when people use xTuple as a launching point for their own projects,
whether or not you have a commercial relationship with us. 

### Why you might be interested in hacking on our software

The xTuple platform provides a great starting point for business software in practically
any industry. What you get for free is an entire stack to work on top of, and a lot
of business objects that you might want, like `Invoices`, `Currencies`, `Tasks` and 
`Contacts` (and about a hundred more) are already implemented.

Moreover, one of the great strengths of the framework is extensibility and privilege
control. Our extension system allows for a high level of modularity, and keeps you
from having to rewrite the core. Fine-grained, centrally-managed privilege 
control is also an important feature that businesses typically want, and
we've taken special care to implement it reliably across the application.

### Getting involved

Fork us, take a test drive with our [free trial](http://www.xtuple.com/free-trial), 
file a github issue. 
If you want to be a contributor and are looking for a place to
make your mark, we're keeping a list of issues that are 
[fair game](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple/issues?labels=fair+game) 
to pick off and provide
a convenient, well-documented starting point into our project.

### Installing this project

The best way to start coding on our stack is to use our
[Vagrant setup](https://github.com/xtuple/xtuple-vagrant/blob/master/README.md).
